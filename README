# CMAP README

CMAP is a collaborative concept mapping application. It is possible to the CMAP tools alone to generate concept maps and  export them as images or Web pages, which can then be added to an ATutor course. Or, if the CMAP server is installed in a central location, and students have the CMAPTools installed, they can collaborate through the server to create concept maps.

Web services for CMAP are currently under development, and in a future release will allow the authoring and storing of Maps from directly within ATutor. For now CMAP is a simple addon to an external application.

See the CMAP web site for complete details about the system.

**Installing the ATutor-CMAP module**
Once the CMAP server has been installed and is functioning properly, unpack the atutor_cmap.tar.gz file into your ATutor mods/ directory. Then login to ATutor as the administrator, choose the modules tab, then choose Install Modules from the Modules submenu. Follow the instructions to install the module, then when installed, enable it to make it avalable to courses on that ATutor server. Finally, access the CMAP tab that gets added to the Administrator main menu, and there enter the URL to the CMAP server. Done.
